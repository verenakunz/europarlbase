The goal of europarlbase is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of {europarlbase} from [GitHub](https://github.com/verenakunz/europarlbase) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("verenakunz/europarlbase")
```

Note that if you don't have the {remotes} package installed on your machine, you have to install it before being able to install the europarlbase package.

To use {europarlbase}, load the package with: 

```{r}
library(europarlbase)
```



## Accessing EuroParlBase

To access EuroParlBase you currently need an access token. To be able to access the database, specify the access token as follows before calling any {europarlbase} functions:

```{r}
## Specify access token
access_token <- "<insert access token>"
```


## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(europarlbase)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
